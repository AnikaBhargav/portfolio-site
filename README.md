# Project Description 
This project is a front-end web page made with React, Node JS, and Tailwind CSS. It is a personal portfolio website to showcase my projects and general information about myself as a software engineer. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Node JS v20 https://nodejs.org/en

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
